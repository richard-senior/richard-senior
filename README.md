# Richard Senior BEng(H)

General Engineer (Control Systems specialist) currently working at a large Telcoms company as a DevOps specialist.
My experience includes : 
* Light engineering (welding, machining etc.)
* Industrial process control (PLC's / SCADA etc.)
* Robotics (design and implementation in industrial applications)
* Very large scale enterprise web applications (Java / Cloud native)
* DevOps (AWS, Kubernetes etc)
* Small signal audio electronics and 74 series digital electronic circuit design
* Software generally (Java / Go / Python mainly, but pretty much any language)

## Interests

Most things nerdy or geeky
Personal projects range from modification of musical instruments to the creation of software
with varying amounts of practicality.

## I’m currently learning

Hobby wise, I'm currently writing a lot of python relating to CNC machining, and go code.
Work wise, I'm currently migrating an old monolithic java app to a more K8's/AI friendly shape.
